By run the main method in Driver.java, this program will generates a random number which decides which sorting algorithms it will use. 
Then print the unsorted and sorted array on the screen. 
The Sort.java has codes for different sorting algorithms such as merge sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, heap sort and quick sort. 
No matter which algorithms generated, the results are the same.
